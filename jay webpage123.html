            Soil Erosion
        </h2>
        <p><h4>
            Soil erosion is a gradual process that occurs when the impact of water or wind detaches and removes soil particles, causing the soil to deteriorate. Soil deterioration and low water quality due to erosion and surface runoff have become severe problems worldwide. The problem may become so severe that the land can no longer be cultivated and must be abandoned. Many agricultural civilizations have declined due to land and natural resource mismanagement, and the history of such civilizations is a good reminder to protect our natural resources.

            Erosion is a serious problem for productive agricultural land and for water quality concerns. Controlling the sediment must be an integral part of any soil management system to improve water and soil quality. Eroded topsoil can be transported by wind or water into streams and other waterways. Sediment is a product of land erosion and derives largely from sheet and rill erosion from upland areas, and to a lesser degree, from cyclic erosion activity in gullies and drainageways.
            
            The impact of soil erosion on water quality becomes significant, particularly as soil surface runoff. Sediment production and soil erosion are closely related. Therefore, the most effective way to minimize sediment production is the stabilization of the sediment source by controlling erosion. Several conservation practices can be used to control erosion but first you need to understand the factors affecting soil erosion. Soil erosion is the detachment and movement of soil particles from the point of origination through the action of water or wind. Thus, minimizing the impact of water or wind forces is the main objective for erosion control. Water erosion is the most pertinent erosion problem in Iowa.
            
            Soil erosion by water occurs when bare-sloped soil surface is exposed to rainfall, and the rainfall intensity exceeds the rate of soil intake, or infiltration rate, leading to soil-surface runoff. Soil erosion can occur in two stages:
             1) detachment of soil particles by raindrop impact, splash, or flowing water; and 
             2) transport of detached particles by splash or flowing water. Therefore, soil erosion is a physical process requiring energy, and its control requires certain measures to dissipate this energy.
            The hydrologic processes of rainfall and runoff play an essential role in water erosion. The amount and rate of surface runoff can affect erosion and sediment transport. Thus, soil conservation practices are important in reducing soil erosion. Improving the soil infiltration rate, resulting in less surface runoff, can lead to reduction of soil erosion. Agronomic, cultural, or structural practices are available for controlling soil erosion. Structural practices involve physical changes in the shape and topography of the land. All these practices are not mutually exclusive. Some situations may require both management and structural changes, where the topography is highly complex. In other situations, erosion control can be achieved by implementing a single practice, where the erosion is minimum, such as the establishment of grassed waterways.

        <h2>Types of Soil Erosion :</h2>
        <p>Soil erosion can occur through different processes, each with its own characteristics and impacts. Some common types include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><h2>Sheet Erosion</h2></li>
            <img src="img2.jpeg" height="300px" width="500px">
            <figcaption>
                Sheet erosion is the uniform loss of soil in thin layers that occurs when rainwater does not permeate into the ground and carries soil particles evenly across the soil surface 
                .It is also known as sheet wash and occurs in a wide range of settings such as coastal plains, hillslopes, floodplains, beaches, savanna plains and semi-arid plains .
                Sheet erosion occurs as a shallow ‘sheet’ of water flowing over the ground surface, resulting in the removal of a uniform layer of soil from the soil surface 2. The thickness of the raindrops and wind force also plays a major role in sheet erosion 3.</figcaption>
            <li><h2>Rill Erosion</h2></li>
            <img src="rill.png" height="300px" width="500px">
            <figcaption>Rill erosion is a type of erosion that results in small, yet well-defined streams.
                It happens when water from rainfall does not soak into the soil, but runs across it instead.
                 The rills or small channels (often only 30cm deep) are caused when water running across the surface of the ground gathers in a natural depression in the soil, and erosion is concentrated as the water flows through the depression 123.
                 Rill erosion represents the intermediate process between sheet and gully erosion 2.
            </figcaption>
            <li><h2>Gully Erosion</h2></li>
            <img src="img3.png" height="300px" width="500px">
            <figcaption>Gully erosion is a type of erosion that results in deep and narrow channels.
                It occurs when water flows over the ground surface and erodes the soil, creating a channel that is deeper than it is wide 12.
                 Gullies are typically more than 30 cm deep and can be several meters wide 2.
                  They are characterized by a distinct headscarp or headwall and progress by headward (i.e. upstream) erosion 1.
                   Gully erosion is commonly related to intermittent or ephemeral water flow, usually associated with localized intense or protracted rainfall events or snowmelt 1.
                    Gullies can be formed and accelerated by cultivation practices on hillslopes in farmland, and they can develop rapidly in rangelands from existing natural erosion forms subject to vegetative cover removal and livestock activity 12.
                     Gully erosion can progress through a variety and combination of processes, including incision and bank erosion by water flow, mass movement of saturated or unsaturated bank or wall material, groundwater seepage, and collapse of soil pipes or tunnels in dispersive soils 1.
                      Gullies reduce the productivity of farmlands where they incise into the land, and produce sediment that may choke downstream waterbodies, and reduce water quality within the drainage system and lake or coastal system 12.

            </figcaption>
            <li><h2>Stream Bank erosion</h2></li>
            <img src="streambank.png" height="300px" width="500px">
            <figcaption>Stream bank erosion is the process of wearing away of the banks of a stream or river 1.
                 It is a naturally occurring process, but the rate at which it occurs is often increased by anthropogenic or human activities such as urbanization and agriculture 2. The roots of trees growing by a stream are undercut by such erosion. As the roots bind the soil tightly, they form abutments which jut out over the water 1. Stream bank erosion can also be accelerated by factors such as stream bed lowering or infill, inundation of bank soils followed by rapid drops in flow after flooding 3.

            </figcaption>
            <li><h2>Rain Drop or Splash Erosion</h2></li>
            <img src="rain drop.jpeg" height="300px" width="500px">
            <figcaption>Splash erosion is the first stage of soil erosion by water. It occurs when raindrops hit bare soil. The explosive impact breaks up soil aggregates so that individual soil particles are ‘splashed’ onto the soil surface 123. The splashed particles can rise up to 60cm above the ground and travel up to 1.5 metres from the point of impact 1.

                Soil erosion is a serious issue in India, where about 45% of the total geographical surface area is affected by serious soil erosion through gorge and gully, shifting cultivation, cultivated wastelands, sandy areas, deserts and water logging 4. Soil erosion leads to deprivation of physical characteristics of soils and damages plant and crops. In Indian condition, the control of soil erosion is a challenging task in the sense that the onset of monsoon often coincides with the kharif sowing and transplanting </figcaption>

        <h1>How to Prevent Soil Erosion :</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><h2>Soil conservation planning</h2></li>
            <p>• The fundamental principle when planning for soil conservation is that land
                should not be used in ways that exceed its capabilities.
                •	 Using land in ways that exceed its capabilities will damage the land and
                cause adverse impacts off-site such as polluting water resources and
                degrading aquatic habitats.
                •	 Characteristics inherent to land, such as its slope, fertility, drainage, or
                rockiness determine its capability for different uses.
                •	 Soil conservation planning involves mapping characteristics of land to
                identify the capability of different areas and to determine which uses the
                land can safely be put to.
                •	 Soil conservation planning also involves identifying areas that are
                vulnerable to damage so that special precautions can be put in place to
                prevent erosion.
                •	 Special precautions will depend on the land use and the nature and extent
                of the vulnerability. They may include actions such as establishing special
                groundcover vegetation, reforming the land surface or constructing contour
                banks.
                •	 Soil conservation planning must be coordinated across the whole landscape.
                It is very rare that both the source and destination of run-0ff are wholly
                contained within a single property</p>
            <li><h2>land management practices</h2></li>
            <p>​​​•​Land management practices describe the way that land is managed - the means by which a land use outcome is achieved.

                •Land management practices have become an increasing focus of ACLUMP because the drivers for better land use outcomes (economic, social and/or environmental) inevitably come from how land is managed. An understanding of the links between land use, land management practice and resource condition supports on-ground decisions to change land management practice, and to support sustainable land use policies and programs.
                
                •Through targeted projects, ACLUMP State and Territory partners have contributed to a national approach for collation of land management practices information.</p>
            <li><h2>Planting cover crops and trees</h2></li>
            <p>
                •if you are planting trees the year after the cover crop is sown, mow the cover crop in the fall.
                •If a lot of weeds appear in the first season, make sure you mow the weeds before they go to seed.
                •raise the height of the mower so that it cuts all the weeds that are taller than the cover crop.</p>
            <li><h2>Contour ploughing</h2></li>
            <p>
            
                •Contour bunding or contour farming or Contour ploughing is the farming practice of plowing and/or planting across a slope following its elevation contour lines.
                •These contour lines create a water break which reduces the formation of rills and gullies during times of heavy precipitation, allowing more time for the water to settle into the soil.In contour plowing, the ruts made by the plow run perpendicular rather than parallel to the slopes, generally furrows that curve around the land and are level. This method is also known for preventing tillage erosion.
                •Tillage erosion is the soil movement and erosion by tilling a given plot of land.
                •A similar practice is contour bunding where stones are placed around the contours of slopes.
                •Contour ploughing has been proved to reduce fertilizer loss, power and time consumption, and wear on machines, as well as to increase crop yields and reduces soil erosion.

                •Soil erosion prevention practices such as this can drastically decrease negative effects associated with soil erosion such as reduced crop productivity, worsened water quality, lower effective reservoir water levels, flooding, and habitat destruction.[4] Contour farming is considered an active form of sustainable agriculture.

            </p>
            <li><h2>Using riprap for slopes</h2></li>
            <p>
                •Riprap is often used for stabilization of construction sites.
                •Section 25.30 of the MPCA Construction Stormwater General Permit (2018) defines stabilization and specifically identifies riprap as an appropriate stabilization measure, stating: “’Stabilize’, ‘Stabilized’, ‘Stabilization’ means the exposed ground surface has been covered by appropriate materials such as mulch, staked sod, riprap, erosion control blanket, mats or other material that prevents erosion from occurring. Grass seeding, agricultural crop seeding or other seeding alone is not stabilization. Mulch materials must achieve approximately 90 percent ground coverage (typically 2 tons of mulch per acre).”

                •Because stabilization is required and essential for most construction activities, it is mentioned numerous times throughout the 2018 Permit. While “riprap” is not specifically mentioned in these instances, it is implicitly included due to its widespread acceptance as an effective stabilization practice. As noted above, before using riprap the site manager should check with the design engineer to ensure that the post-construction configuration includes riprap prior to its installation. In many cases it may be far less expensive to install the post-construction vegetation with whatever stabilization matrix is called for (e.g., turf reinforcement mat, articulated concrete mat, geogrid, etc.) during construction, rather than having to place and then later remove riprap. Several key locations in the permit that mention stabilization are noted below.

        <h1>Causes of Soil Erosion</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><h2>Overgrazing</h2></li>
            <img src="Overgrazing.jpg" height="300px" width="500px">
             <figcaption>Overgrazing occurs when plants are exposed to intensive grazing for extended periods of time, or without sufficient recovery periods. It can be caused by either livestock in poorly managed agricultural applications, game reserves, or nature reserves. It can also be caused by immobile, travel restricted populations of native or non-native wild animals.

                Overgrazing reduces the usefulness, productivity and biodiversity of the land and is one cause of desertification and erosion.
                 Overgrazing is also seen as a cause of the spread of invasive species of non-native plants and of weeds. Degrading land, emissions from animal agriculture and reducing the biomass in a ecosystem contribute directly to climate change between grazing events. Successful planned grazing strategies have been in support of the American bison of the Great Plains, or migratory wildebeest of the African savannas,or by holistic planned grazing</figcaption>
            <li><h2>Deforestation</h2></li>
            <img src="deforestation.jpg" width="500px" height="300px">
            <figcaption>Deforestation is the large-scale removal of trees from forests (or other lands) for the facilitation of human activities. It is a serious environmental concern since it can result in the loss of biodiversity, damage to natural habitats, disturbances in the water cycle, and soil erosion 1. Deforestation is also a contributor to climate change and global warming 1.

                Forests are important for the survival of life on earth. They combat climate change by absorbing greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide) and acting as a carbon storehouse. They are a source of oxygen, food, clean water, and medicine. They play a vital role in the water cycle they work to add water to the atmosphere via the process of transpiration. Forests help mitigate the disastrous effects of floods by acting as a floodwater sink. Therefore, deforestation also increases the vulnerability of the landmass to certain natural calamities 1</figcaption>
            <li><h2>Improper tillage practices</h2></li>
            <img src="improper.jpg" height="300px" width="500px">
            <figcaption>Improper tillage practices can lead to soil degradation and loss of soil fertility. Tillage is the process of preparing soil for planting by breaking up the soil and mixing it with organic matter. Improper tillage practices can cause soil erosion, soil compaction, and nutrient depletion 123.

                Soil degradation is a serious issue that can lead to a decrease in crop yield and food production. It can also lead to the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services 1.
                
                There are several ways to prevent soil degradation due to improper tillage practices. One way is to use conservation tillage practices, which involve reducing the amount of tillage and leaving crop residues on the soil surface. This can help to reduce soil erosion and improve soil health 2. Another way is to use cover crops to help protect the soil from erosion and nutrient depletion 3.</figcaption>
            <li><h2>Excessive use of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers</h2></li>
            <img src="fertilizers.jpeg" height="300px" width="500px">
            <figcaption>Excessive use of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers can lead to eutrophication of water bodies, which is the process of nutrient enrichment of water bodies leading to excessive growth of algae, deoxygenation and loss of aquatic biodiversity. Nitrogen and phosphorus are the two main fertilizers that farmers add to their fields. Research presented here shows that nearly two-thirds of the nitrogen we use on our crops becomes a pollutant; more than half of applied phosphorus does .

                The excessive use of fertilizers can also lead to the release of harmful greenhouse gases into the atmosphere 
                
                It is important to note that the use of fertilizers is essential for crop growth. However, it is important to use them in moderation and in accordance with the recommended guidelines. The recommended guidelines vary depending on the crop and soil type. It is important to consult with local agricultural experts to determine the best fertilization practices for your specific situation</figcaption>
            <li><h2>Erosion-prone soils</h2></li>
            <img src="erosion.jpeg" height="300px" width="500px">
            <figcaption>
                Soil erosion is the process of soil particles being carried away by physical sources such as wind and water . Soils that are more prone to erosion are those with the largest amount of medium (silt)-size particles. Clay and sandy soils are less prone to erosion .

                Soil erosion can lead to a decrease in crop yield and food production. It can also lead to the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services .
                
                There are several ways to prevent soil erosion due to erosion-prone soils. One way is to use conservation tillage practices, which involve reducing the amount of tillage and leaving crop residues on the soil surface. This can help to reduce soil erosion and improve soil health 13. Another way is to use cover crops to help protect the soil from erosion and nutrient depletion
